# Week 1 fail log
This first week has been a bit difficult. While I was able to follow the instructions and create the three accounts, it seemed to take me quite a while to get used to so many new programs.  

## First Annotation
My [first annotation] (https://hyp.is/VQh2CnUDEemIWheYzpbd2Q/site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/rubric-and-assessment.html) was about the weekly reflections through blog posts. I was not sure where, how or what format to complete these in. I was able to contact a classmate through hypothesis who directed me to a blog post that helped me start up a webpage through github.

## Second Annotation
My [second annotation](https://hyp.is/kOzPoHUWEemMsHuZ4WAPtA/site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/tldr.html)has to do with connecting to the team via slack. I could not get access to this at all. I eventually realized you have to ask the host of the group for access. I will try to ask the professor. 

## Third Annotation
My [third annotation](https://hyp.is/f-kBPnX7EemjFLcBvaEu7w/www.cambridge.org/core/books/history-manifesto/big-questions-big-data/F60D7E21EFBD018F5410FB315FBA4590) This is one of my first annotations in a reading. I really enjoyed using hypothesis as I do my readings. Interacting with the community and  my peers while also sharing my ideas as a student is a useful feature. Learning to use technology in this way fosters a great learning and collaboration environment. 


## Comments/Concerns
All in all I am surprised by how much I've learned this week. I am also excited to dive into learning how to use github it seems like a useful tool.
